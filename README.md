# To-do-list-localstorage

## Overview

This is a simple To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with local storage support. The project allows users to add, manage, and persist tasks across sessions by storing them in the browser's local storage.

## Features

- Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to the list.
- Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list.
- Local Storage: Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after the browser is closed or refreshed.
- Responsive Design: Adapted for various screen sizes and devices.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: For structuring the web pages.
- CSS: For styling the application and making it responsive.
- JavaScript: For adding functionality and interactivity to the to-do list.
